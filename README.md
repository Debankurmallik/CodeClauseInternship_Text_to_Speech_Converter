# CodeClauseInternship_Text_to_Speech_Converter
A text-to-speech (TTS) converter is a software tool that converts written text into spoken words. In Python, building a TTS system is relatively simple, thanks to library pyttsx3.
Here I use pyttsx3.
Input Handling: The user will input text to be converted into speech.
Voice Selection: The user will have the option to choose between available voices (e.g., male or female).
Text-to-Speech Processing: Using the pyttsx3 library, the input text will be converted to speech, with the chosen voice and speech rate.
